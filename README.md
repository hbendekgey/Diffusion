# Scaling study of diffusion in dynamic crowded space
Codebase for [this paper of the same name]([http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02444])

<tt>code/</tt> contains all the C code necessary to run simulations (<tt>cdiff.c</tt>), get the configuration of the system at a particular point in time (<tt>show_conf.c</tt>) and get aggregate diffusivity information over the course of a run (<tt>calc_dr2.c</tt>) input files and an input generator file are also included.
<tt>figs/</tt> contains data (results from our simulations) and gnuplot files necessary to reproduce the figures in our paper.
<tt>scripts/</tt> contains the scripts we used to run a large number of simulations in parallel over a range of different parameter values.
Note that for the scripts to be run, they must be in the same directory as the executable code file and the input files. They are separated in this repo for improved clarity.
